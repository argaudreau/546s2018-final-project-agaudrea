 What I Did This Week
======================
The biggest thing I did this week was add textures to the floor, spawnable objects, and the sun (the first two of which are configurable).
The floor's texture can be changed at any time, and an object can be set to have a texture before it spawns.
Speaking of the floor, you can now change the size of it. (How-To in the manual).
The sun now has a configurable intensity setting.
You can set objects to always rotate so you can see some quick animations.
